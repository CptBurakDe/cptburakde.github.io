  {
    "question": "What is the fundamental difference in the IGC Code design safety philosophy between Type A tanks and Type B tanks that mandates a complete secondary barrier for Type A?",
    "options": [
      "Type A tanks are not designed on the leak before failure concept",

      "Type A tanks do not undergo detailed stress analysis"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "The requirement for a complete secondary barrier on Type A tanks stems from the fact that, unlike Type B tanks, they are not designed and proven to the 'leak before failure' concept."

      "1.0 bar",
      "2.0 bar",
      "1.5 bar"
    ],
