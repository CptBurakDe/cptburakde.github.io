    "question": "Why must cargo tanks on gas carriers be equipped with separate ballast tanks?",
    "options": [
      "To facilitate easier purging operations after cargo discharge.",
      "Because the cargo tanks are not designed for the carriage of ballast.",
      "To comply with stability requirements only during loading operations.",
      "To increase the efficiency of the reliquefaction process."
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "A unique feature of gas carrier design is that the cargo tanks are not designed to carry water ballast. Consequently, gas carriers must be designed with separate ballast tanks to meet stability and structural requirements."

  {
    "question": "What is the relationship between ventilation and the extent of hazardous zones in an enclosed space?",
    "options": [
      "Increasing ventilation reduces the extent of hazardous zones.",
      "Ventilation is only used to manage toxic gases, not flammable zones.",
      "Ventilation rate does not affect the size of Zone 0 or Zone 1 areas.",
      "Decreasing ventilation ensures the zones will not fill the entire space."
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Ventilation directly influences the size and persistence of gas/air mixtures. The standard states that the higher the amount of ventilation in relation to the possible release rates, the smaller the extent of the hazardous zones will be, potentially reducing them to a negligible extent (non-hazardous area)."
