    "question": "Which statement correctly defines the **Lower Flammable Limit (LFL)** of a gas/air mixture?",
    "options": [
      "The concentration at which the mixture is 'over rich' and lacks oxygen.",
      "The concentration at which combustion produces carbon monoxide (CO).",
      "The minimum gas concentration required to support combustion (too lean below this).",
      "The maximum gas concentration that will burn (too rich above this)."

  {
    "question": "Liquefied gases are typically transported at temperatures above their flash point. Why does this not cause an immediate fire hazard in the cargo tanks?",
    "options": [
      "The gas is chemically inhibited from burning at high temperatures.",
      "The atmosphere within the tank is safely inerted, remaining below the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL).",
      "Air is excluded, keeping the atmosphere 'over rich' (above UFL) and non-flammable.",
      "The tank's static charge is too high to allow ignition."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between the Higher Heating Value (HHV) and the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of a fuel gas?",
    "options": [
      "HHV assumes condensation of water vapor, while LHV does not.",
      "LHV measures the heat released during incomplete combustion (CO production).",
      "HHV includes the heat absorbed by the fuel at the start of combustion.",
      "LHV measures the total energy released, assuming products are cooled to original conditions."

    "question": "In the event of a liquefied gas leak in open air, where does the dangerous flammable zone (C) occur?",
    "options": [
      "Right at the leak source (Zone B), where the mixture is over rich.",
      "At the farthest downwind point (Zone D), where the mixture is too lean.",
      "At a certain distance downwind from the leak, where the concentration is between the LFL and UFL.",
      "The entire vapor cloud is uniformly flammable."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following gases is classified by the IGC Code as **\"non-flammable\"** primarily because its Minimum Ignition Energy (MIE) is extremely high, and the heat released during combustion is often insufficient to sustain the reaction?",
    "options": [
      "Ethylene",
      "Propane",
      "Methane",
      "Ammonia"

    "question": "What is the lowest temperature at which a gas/air mixture will spontaneously ignite **without** the need for an external spark or flame source?",
    "options": [
      "Flash Point",
      "Auto-ignition Temperature",
      "Boiling Point",
      "Lower Flammable Limit (LFL)"

  {
    "question": "What is the primary function of an **Insulation Flange** placed between the ship's piping and the shore terminal's system?",
    "options": [
      "To allow high voltage static charges to safely pass to the ground while preventing the flow of low voltage current.",
      "To prevent any static charge buildup in the ship's piping system.",
      "To ensure continuous electrical bonding between the ship and shore.",
      "To increase the Minimum Ignition Energy (MIE) of the cargo."

  {
    "question": "What hazardous gas is produced during the **incomplete (partial) combustion** of a hydrocarbon when there is insufficient oxygen present?",
    "options": [
      "Water Vapor ($H_2O$)",
      "Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$)",
      "Ethylene ($C_2H_4$)",
      "Carbon Monoxide (CO)"

  {
    "question": "Why does static electricity pose a significant ignition risk when handling liquefied gases?",
    "options": [
      "Liquefied gases act as excellent electrical conductors, rapidly transferring charge.",
      "The friction of the fluid flowing through pipes can generate static charges, and the accumulated energy can exceed the very low Minimum Ignition Energy of hydrocarbon vapors.",
      "The process requires an external flame or spark, which is always present due to static.",
      "The static charge directly causes the cargo's temperature to rise above its auto-ignition temperature."
