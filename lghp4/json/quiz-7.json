    "question": "Which highly reactive compound requires the addition of an inhibitor to the cargo as a **mandatory** requirement under the IGC Code?",
    "options": [
      "Propylene",
      "Ethylene",
      "Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM)",
      "Butadiene"
    ],

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary reason why the inhibitor remains effective mainly in the liquid phase of the cargo?",
    "options": [
      "The inhibitor gradually consumes the oxygen in the vapor space.",
      "The inhibitor has a much lower vapour pressure than the cargo, causing it to mostly stay in the liquid.",
      "The cargo's low temperature causes the inhibitor to polymerize in the liquid.",
      "The IGC Code restricts inhibitor placement only to the liquid phase."

    "question": "Which of the following substances poses a high risk of forming solid 'hydrates' with most hydrocarbons, even at temperatures above 0°C?",

  {
    "question": "Why should methanol or ethanol **never** be added to a cargo that already contains a polymerization inhibitor?",
    "options": [
      "The mixture creates an explosive atmosphere in the tank.",
      "Methanol/ethanol significantly increase the dimerization rate of the cargo.",
      "These chemicals can disrupt the polymerization inhibition mechanism.",
      "The resulting mixture becomes highly corrosive to the mild steel tanks."

  {
    "question": "What is the critical action recommended to slow down the dimerization reaction in cargoes like Butadiene, as this process cannot be stopped by inhibitors?",
    "options": [
      "Adding a high concentration of TBC inhibitor to the cargo.",
      "Heating the cargo to above $10^{\\circ}C$ to vaporize the dimer.",
      "Keeping the cargo temperature as cool as possible, preferably below $4^{\\circ}C$.",
      "Increasing the oxygen content in the vapor space to stabilize the monomer."

    "answer": 2
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the specific function of Tertiary Butyl Catechol (TBC) when added to Butadiene cargo?",
    "options": [
      "To increase the overall cargo density.",
      "To function primarily as an oxygen scavenger, removing oxygen which acts as a polymerization catalyst.",
      "To react directly with the double bonds to form single bonds.",
      "To increase the boiling point, reducing the cargo's vapor pressure."

    "answer": 1

  {
    "question": "According to the IGC Code, which crucial information must be detailed on the **Inhibitor Certificate** provided by the shipper?",
    "options": [
      "The maximum flow rate allowed during discharge.",
      "The precise molecular formula of the cargo monomer.",
      "The duration for which the inhibitor is expected to remain effective.",
      "The atmospheric boiling point of the specific inhibitor used."

      "Propylene Oxide",
      "Ethylene"

  },
  {
    "question": "Which dangerous outcome is possible if the inhibitor in a polymerization-prone cargo (like VCM) is completely consumed during a long voyage?",
    "options": [
      "The cargo will rapidly convert back into a gaseous state.",
      "The cargo will undergo immediate solidification, becoming viscous, hot, and impossible to pump.",
      "The cargo's density will drop, leading to buoyancy issues for the ship.",
      "The cargo will lose its toxic properties, but remain highly flammable."

      "Clogging of filters, spray nozzles, and pump intake valves.",
